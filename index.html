    </p title>
    <p description>
     Many people in Finland are affected the weather, especially the sunlight because of the short daylength during the winter. I realized the daylength becomes short as the temperature goes down. But I do not know exactly the daylength looks like. Comparing the two cities, Helsinki and Seoul can show the daylength of Finland is very unoccassional. This data visualization is based on www.timeanddate.com.
